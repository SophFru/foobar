# Google Foobar
In January 2022, I googled a question I had about OOP design. I was then invited to attempt Google's coding challenge, [Foobar](https://foobar.withgoogle.com/). 

There are 5 levels total, each level is more difficult than the last. I completed levels 1 and 2 and most of level 3. Each challenge had the same [constraints](constraints.md) and included some [flavor text](journal.md).

### Level 1

[The Cake is Not a Lie] - logic problem

### Level 2

[Elevator Maintenance] - sorting a list of version numbers

[Ion Flux Relabeling] - searching a perfect binary tree

### Level 3

[Prepare the Bunnies' Escape] - find the shortest path in a maze where you are allowed to remove one wall

[Find the Access Codes] - find lucky triples in a list of integers
